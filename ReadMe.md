## OPEN BANK TECHNICAL ASSESMENT

### Basic Information

The assesment consist of developing an iOS App in Swift that fetch characters from Marvel API service and are drawn in a table. When one item is tapped app navigates to detail. 

The app is developed using XCode 12.5.1 and is compiled in Swift 5.0

### Architecture
The app is develope using a MVVM architecture using coordinators, viewControllers and viewModels. 
Network layer is developed using RxSwift and Alamofire.

### Dependencies

 **_RxSwift & RxCocoa_**
 
 Rx is a generic abstraction of computation expressed through Observable<Element> interface.

It tries to port as many concepts from the original version as possible, but some concepts were adapted for more pleasant and performant integration with iOS/macOS environment.

Cross platform documentation can be found on ReactiveX.io.

Like the original Rx, its intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and event/data streams.

KVO observing, async operations and streams are all unified under abstraction of sequence. This is the reason why Rx is so simple, elegant and powerful.

**_Alamofire_**

Alamofire is an HTTP networking library written in Swift.

**_Google Maps SDK_**

Build customized, agile experiences that bring the real world to your users with static and dynamic maps, Street View imagery, and 360° views.

#### Install Cocoa Pods

- this installs the CocoaPods application
- CocoaPods is a Ruby gem
- do the same to update Cocoa Pods

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

---


#### Creating a Podfile

```
pod init
```


---

#### The Podfile


```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks! # Comment this if you're not using Swift 
                # and don't want to use dynamic frameworks

#inhibit_all_warnings!

project 'MyApp.xcodeproj'

target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'SwiftyJSON'
  pod 'KingFisher'
end
```

---

## Install pods

- Install project dependencies according to versions from a Podfile.loc
- creates a Workspace
    - __use the workspace!__

```bash
$ pod install

Analyzing dependencies
Downloading dependencies
Generating Pods project
Integrating client project
...
```

---

## Update / add / remove pods

1. edit Podfile
1. run `pod install` again
